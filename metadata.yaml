description: The boundaries between theology and science are explored in this ambitious
  1883 work. The author demanded "perfect freedom" for scientific inquiry, yet adhered
  to "the truths of Christianity in their full extent." Well-versed in both religion
  and Darwin's theories, the author handles his task with logic, fairness, and an
  engaging generosity of spirit.
